  <h1>Gragon Ball Power Sensor</h1>
  <p>
    Greetings! Our final project for interactive web class is based on the
    ki/chi mechanism in the popular anime Dragon Ball.<br>
    By contracting muscle and reading in the contraction with Myo muscle sensor
    the VR world will generate yellow orbs/particles based on the level of contraction.<br>
    We will add more particle or environmental elements into the world as we progress.<br>
    Thank you for reading!<br>
